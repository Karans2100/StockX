RI,Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail valued at $34 bn in new share-swap scheme,Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd holds 99.95 per cent of Reliance Retail. The remaining 0.05 per cent is with employees.  ,"Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail, which runs the country's largest chain of neighbourhood supermarket stores and consumer electronics outlets, has been valued at $34 billion (Rs 2.4 lakh crore) in a proposed share-swap scheme for shareholders.  Reliance Retail's shareholders have will get one share of its listed parent, Reliance Industries, in exchange for every four shares, according to the scheme of arrangement posted on Reliance Retail's website.  The share-swap values Reliance Retail at about Rs 2.4 lakh crore.  Reliance Retail is an unlisted subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures and an indirect subsidiary of oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).  RIL's shares ended at Rs 1,515.95 apiece on the BSE, giving the company a market cap of Rs 9.6 lakh crore.  In August, RIL had said that it may list Reliance Retail on the stock exchanges in the next five years. Reliance Retail clocked net sales of Rs 1.3 lakh crore last year and has built a network of 10,901 stores.  In the scheme of arrangement, Reliance Retail said it had given employees stock options in 2006 and 2007. &amp;quot;On exercise of the RSUs (restricted stock units) by some of the employees, equity shares have been allotted to them.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The company has been receiving requests from the employees holding equity shares for providing them options for exit and liquidity, including by way of a listing of the equity shares,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The company does not have any plan for listing of its equity shares on the stock exchanges&amp;quot; and so the share swap scheme.  In the proposed scheme, &amp;quot;equity shareholders of the company other than the holding company viz, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd are being given listed equity shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (the ultimate holding company of the firm) and the corresponding equity share capital held by them in the company is being reduced and cancelled.&amp;quot;  Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd holds 99.95 per cent of Reliance Retail. The remaining 0.05 per cent is with employees.  &amp;quot;Since the scheme does not contemplate any outflow of funds/assets of the company, the aggregate of 'equity and other equity' of the company pre- and post-implementation of the scheme will remain the same and unaltered,&amp;quot; it said.  The company said pursuant to the December 17 order of the Mumbai-bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, a meeting of the equity shareholders of Reliance Retail Ltd is being convened on January 23 for approving the Scheme of Arrangement.  Reliance Retail is mainly engaged in the organised retail spanning across various consumption baskets primarily catering to Indian consumers.  It has been set up to &amp;quot;run, operate business centres, hypermarkets, departmental stores, supermarkets, shopping malls, specialty stores, shopping outlets, convenience stores, wholesale, cash and carry operations, non-store formats, warehouses, distribution centers, collection centers, depots and showrooms&amp;quot;.  The firm has been set up to market &amp;quot;all commercial, industrial, scientific, household, food products, consumer goods, consumer durables and other consumer's necessities of every kind, and all other types of general goods, consumables, materials, accessories, commodities and equipment&amp;quot;.  In the second quarter ending September 30, 2019, Reliance Retail reported a 27 per cent growth in revenues to Rs 41,202 crore with strong growth across formats. Operating profit grew 66.8 per cent to Rs 2,322 crore, driven by margins improvement. It has 24.5 million square feet of retail store area under operation.  The valuation of Reliance Retail, which is also the top wholesale supplier to small shopkeepers, is double that of Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs India's biggest supermarket chain. Tesco is valued at $32 billion.

RI,"Reliance tears into govt affidavit, says no final arbitration award due","In a counter affidavit, Reliance said it was a &amp;quot;falsehood&amp;quot; to say that the arbitration tribunal had passed an award requiring the company and its partners to pay USD 3.5 billion to the government. ","Reliance Industries has mounted a strong counter to the government petition in the Delhi High Court seeking to block its $15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco, saying the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company.  In a counter affidavit, Reliance said it was a &amp;quot;falsehood&amp;quot; to say that the arbitration tribunal had passed an award requiring the company and its partners to pay $3.5 billion to the government.  It said the petition is an abuse of process as &amp;quot;it portrays that a sum of money is due and payable under the final award and purports to compute the money payable on a basis neither found in the arbitration award nor disclosed in the petition.&amp;quot;  The government, it said, has calculated on its own volition the revised figure of its share of profit from oil and gas production allegedly due by extrapolating the purported finds.  The affidavit came in response to the government moving the Delhi High Court seeking to block Reliance selling 20 per cent stake in its oil and chemical business to Saudi Aramco for $15 billion, in view of pending dues of $3.5 billion in Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields.  An international arbitration tribunal issued a partial award in October 2016 in the dispute between the Government of India (GoI), BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Limited (BG) and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) regarding the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).  The tribunal in its 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.  Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by BG/RIL before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of BG/RIL and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of BG/RIL.  While this challenge was pending in the English court, GoI unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.  Reliance said pursuant to the 2018 award, GoI's claim comes down very significantly -- a fact which the government has not taken cognisance of and approached the Delhi High Court prematurely for enforcement of its claim computed based on its interpretation of the 2016 award.  RIL maintained that except as quantified by the tribunal, no amount can be said to be payable at this stage.  GoI has challenged the 2018 award and the English court is yet to pronounce its judgment.  One of the most significant issues pending before the tribunal is an increase in the Cost Recovery Limit under the PSC. The arbitration tribunal is scheduled to hear BG/RIL's application for increase of PSC Cost Recovery Limit next year.  If the tribunal decides in favour of BG/RIL, then GoI's computation of sums allegedly payable by ONGC, BG and RIL is expected to further come down.  Final amounts payable, if any, by the parties (ONGC 40 per cent, BG 30 per cent and RIL 30 per cent) can only be determined by the arbitration tribunal in the quantification phase of the arbitration which will be scheduled after it has decided on all the issues before it, it said.  ONGC, who was directed by GoI in 2011 not to participate in the arbitration proceedings but be bound by the award, wrote to the stock exchanges in May 2018 that the government's demand is premature.  The 2016 award, in part superseded by the 2018 award, cannot be said to have attained finality and attempts to enforce the 2016 award are premature, RIL said.

RI,Shell-Reliance give up Panna-Mukta fields; western offshore fields to revert to ONGC,"Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast were in 1994 awarded a consortium of US energy giant Enron and Reliance. ONGC, which had originally discovered the fields, as a government nominee given 40 per cent back-in rights.","After operating Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields for 25 years, Royal Dutch Shell and Reliance Industries will revert the western offshore fields back to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), the companies said in a statement.  Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast were in 1994 awarded a consortium of US energy giant Enron and Reliance. ONGC, which had originally discovered the fields, as a government nominee given 40 per cent back-in rights.  Enron during its bankruptcy was taken over by BG Group of UK in 2003. BG Group's interest was subsequently taken over by Shell in 2016.  The 25-year production sharing contracts for the PMT fields expires this week and Reliance and Shell had decided not to seek an extension for Panna-Mukta fields.  &amp;quot;After 25 years of operating the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Joint Venture partners will be handing over the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields back to the Government of India's (GOI) nominee i.e. ONGC on December 21, 2019,&amp;quot; a joint statement issued by Reliance and Shell said.  Reliance and BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) hold 30 per cent stake each in PMT while the balance 40 per cent is with ONGC.  &amp;quot;The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the Government of India in 1994, will expire on December 21, 2019,&amp;quot; it said.  The Tapti fields had ceased production earlier in 2016 and the Tapti process platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (GOI nominee) in 2016.  Decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, are currently being carried out by the PMT JV under India's first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project.  The Tapti decommissioning and other commercial activities would continue in BGEPIL even after Panna-Mukta handover, as per the statement.  The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.  Speaking on the development, Trivikram Arun, Managing Director, BGEPIL said, &amp;quot;The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India's largest national oil company (ONGC), India's largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell).&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term,&amp;quot; he said.  B Ganguly, President-E&amp;amp;amp;P, Reliance said, &amp;quot;At their peak, Panna-Mukta have contributed to nearly 6 per cent of India's oil production and almost 7 per cent of India's gas production in the year 2007-08. Reliance has been a part of this journey and contributed, by providing energy, to the growth and development of India's oil and gas sector.&amp;quot;  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"
RI,"Reliance, BP sign pact to set up petrol pumps under Jio-BP brand","The venture is expected to be formed during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  ","Reliance Industries and British energy giant BP plc on December 16 signed a partnership agreement to jointly grow the Indian firm's network of petrol pumps to 5,500 from current 1,400, the companies said. &amp;quot;BP and RIL signed a definitive agreement relating to the formation of their new Indian fuels and mobility joint venture. This follows the initial heads of agreement signed in August this year,&amp;quot; a statement said.  The venture is expected to be formed during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  RIL currently has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 30-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These will be taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and grown in future.  RIL will hold 51 per cent in the new joint venture company while BP will have the remaining 49 per cent. This will assume ownership of RIL's existing Indian fuel retail network and access its aviation fuel business.  In August, RIL had said BP will pay about Rs 7,000 crore for acquiring a 49 per cent stake in its existing petrol pumps and aviation turbine fuel network.  This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought 30 per cent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India.  The country currently has 66,408 petrol pumps, with public sector retailers owning 59,831. PSU retailers have plans to double this network and have already starting appointing dealers.  Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, formerly Essar Oil, has 5,453 petrol pumps and has plans to scale them up to more than 7,000 in two-three years.  Royal Dutch Shell has 167 outlets and is slated to add 150-200 more petrol pumps.  BP had in 2016 received a licence from the government to set up 3,500 petrol pumps in India but it didn't move on that authorisation.  French energy giant Total SA too is keen on entering the Indian retail market and has tied up with Adani Group for the same.  &amp;quot;The new venture, further development of RIL and BP's longstanding partnership, will include an India-wide fuels retail service station network and aviation fuel marketing business. Building from RIL's existing businesses, the partners expect the venture to co-create a world-class fuels partnership to grow rapidly and help meet India's fast-growing demands for energy and mobility,&amp;quot; the statement issued on Monday said.  The partnership, it said, will expand the fuel and ATF network to up to 5,500 petrol pumps and 45 aviation fuel stations over the next five years.  &amp;quot;The retail network will operate under the Jio-BP brand, signalling a new paradigm shift in fuels marketing and mobility solutions. It brings together Reliance's extensive access and connection to consumers through its Jio digital platform and BP's deep experience in fuel retailing around the world. The joint venture will seek to offer Indian consumers high-quality differentiated fuels, convenience and services,&amp;quot; the statement said.  BP's Castrol lubricants will also be available across the venture's network.  The agreement was signed in Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL and Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP.  Ambani said: &amp;quot;I am delighted that BP and Reliance are further building on their strong partnership. BP and Reliance are combining their knowledge, expertise and experience to provide Indian consumers world-class products and services. We believe that together we will bring solutions that will benefit the fast-growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Bob Dudley said: &amp;quot;India is one of the world's most important energy markets &ndash; its transport and aviation sectors are growing and evolving rapidly. We aim to meet the country's growing demand for mobility solutions, high-quality fuels and services through this new venture. This major expansion of our business here reinforces our long-term commitment to India.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"
RI,Reliance Industries tops Fortune India 500 list ending IOC's 10-year reign,"With a revenue of Rs 5.81 lakh crore in 2018-19, the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate also became the first privately-held and the only other company to become India's largest corporation apart from IOC for the first time in 10 years, Fortune India said.","Reliance Industries&nbsp;has displaced state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to top the Fortune India 500 list.  Reliance's consumer-facing businesses like telecom and organised retail have helped it become India's largest company, ending the decade-long reign of IOC.  Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries posted a 41.5 percent growth in FY19 revenue to Rs 5.81 lakh crore, 8.4 percent higher than IOC's Rs 5.36 lakh crore revenue for the year. RIL's FY19 profit at Rs 39,588 crore, was also more than double that of IOC.  &amp;quot;Over the past 10 years, the oil-to-retail conglomerate's profit has been an average three times higher than that of IOC. The highest it touched compared to IOC was up to 4.8 times, in FY15 when RIL's profit was Rs 23,566 crore and the public sector major's stood at Rs 4,912 crore,&amp;quot; it said.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), State Bank of India, Tata Motors and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL)&nbsp;followed IOC with no changes in their ranking between 2018 and 2019.  The ranking does not include subsidiaries. So, ONGC's ranking does not reflect those from its recently-acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) as well as ONGC Videsh.  Rajesh Exports bagged&nbsp;the seventh rank on the 2019 list, jumping one position. Tata Steel, Coal India, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro also stepped up one rank each to the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th positions, respectively.  ICICI Bank jumped two spots to the 12th position. Hindalco Industries and HDFC Bank followed.  Vedanta, however, slipped three spots to the&nbsp;18th rank.  Overall, the revenue of the Fortune India 500 companies in the 2019 list grew 9.53 percent, while profit rose 11.8 percent.  A total of 57 companies dropped off the list for reasons including consolidation within the public sector banks, public sector undertakings, as well as the private sector.  This year, the total loss posted by the 500 companies also came down, with 65 companies posting a cumulative loss of Rs 1.67 lakh crore, compared to last year's Rs 2 lakh crore racked up by 79 companies, Fortune India said.  Public and private sector banks faced diverse fortunes in 2019. As many as 14 of 22 public sector banks reported cumulative losses of Rs 74,253 crore. In contrast, just two private sector banks posted losses (IDFC First Bank, at Rs 1,907.9 crore; and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, at Rs 894.1 crore). The total profit of 24 of private sector banks (including foreign banks and cooperative banks) was Rs 60,747 crore, a 6.16 percent increase over 2017-18.  Fortune India said the oil and gas sector (with eight companies) accounted for 22.3 percent of the total revenue of the 500 companies, followed by banking with 15.88 percent of the total.  The banking sector, with 48 companies, is also the biggest contributor by way of the number of companies on the list. Oil and gas, however, has the highest share of profit in the 500, at 23.44 percent.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;  With inputs from PTI"
RI,"Reliance forms a base, recommend delta appreciating based &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo;",The overall technical structure is quite bullish after hitting fresh all-time high and the stock has consolidated at near its 20-Day Moving average. ,"Chhitij Jain  Strategy setup - Delta-based &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo;  The market has reclaimed lost ground in the past two trading sessions after a mild correction and many stocks which were in strong uptrend have&nbsp;gone through a phase of consolidation, ready for the next leg of the rally.    We have selected Reliance Industries&nbsp;from the pack. After hitting the fresh all-time high, stock has formed a base and appearing to be ready for fresh up move again. Hence, we would recommend the delta appreciating based &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo; in the counter.  As we have appropriate time left for the expiry, it will be prudent to go for Delta Based strategy to capture the up move.  Option Chain Analysis  The initial signal of an up move has been witnessed in the option chain, as Call option of 1,580 strike price has lost 236,000 contracts in open interest which suggest that bears are on the back foot. On the other hand, bulls have shown confidence and fresh writing of 71,500 contracts has been witnessed in 1580 strike price Put option.  The last concern for the bulls is now at 1,600 level, where maximum outstanding Open Interest (OI) is placed on the Call side and traders can expect sharp move in the counter once the level is taken out on higher side.  Stock seems to be ready for the rally till 1,640 level, which is a probable target as per option chain. 1,640 CE holds approximately 9 lakh contracts on short side and likely to be an appropriate profit booking point for the bulls.  Technical and Market Structure  The overall technical structure is quite bullish after hitting fresh all-time high and the stock has consolidated at near its 20-Day Moving average. Now, the sign of revival is appearing again and stock is falling in the category of reversal after retracement.  After the convergence, the short term moving averages are again opening up and moving upwards. RSI is bouncing back from the important support levels and trading in a bullish zone.  Apart from this, 38.2 percent retracement move is also respected in the counter as per Fibonacci theory. Traders can expect the fresh all-time highs in the counter in days to come and project the immediate target of Rs 1,640.  Apart from the technical structure, the overall sentiments are also bullish in the stock. We have witnessed many broking houses have put the stock in &ldquo;outperforming&rdquo; category and raised their price targets.  Strategy  Looking at the overall structure, we believe traders can opt for &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo; where In the Money call option can be bought and to hedge positions Out Of the Money call option can be sold. As delta of OTM CE is almost half in comparison to ITM CE, the appreciation in ITM option premium will be almost double.  BUY 1580 CE AT 35 (DELTA - 0.53) SELL 1640 CE 12.45 (DELTA - 0.25) MAXIMUM PROFIT - 37.45 MAXIMUM LOSS - 22.55  &amp;amp;nbsp;  The author is CFA at Rudra Shares &amp;amp;amp; Stock Brokers  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Over the past decade, RIL's post-tax ROCE (return on capital employed) has been range-bound around 7-8 per cent. &amp;quot;We think this trend is set to be reversed as the telecom tariff increase should raise returns on $50 billion of investments (50 per cent of the last capital expenditure cycle).&amp;quot;  Last week, top-three mobile operators Bharti Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea increased prepaid tariffs by 14-33 per cent.  &amp;quot;We see ROCE rising to 11 per cent in two years as consumer portfolio returns inch closer to energy ROCE of around 14 per cent,&amp;quot; it said adding although overall returns are still below levels since 2004, an uplift in the chemical cycle from current troughs should boost ROCE higher.  Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of RIL, last week raised tariff by up to 39 per cent following hikes effected by other service providers. The hike will boost revenue over the next four quarters as the revamped plans will restrict down-trading-led revenue leakage.  Edelweiss in a separate report said while the industry's average revenue per user (ARPU) has plunged 33 per cent over the past four years, voice usage per customer has jumped 84 per cent and data usage by 47-times providing enough value to customers to justify the tariff hike.  &amp;quot;We expect industry ARPUs to improve over Q4FY20-Q3FY21 led by users optimising spends by advancing recharges as well as consolidating SIMs,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Moreover, users are likely to delay recharges as well as down-trades, especially in the voice segment.&amp;quot;  However, the new tariff plans are still affordable and the hikes are expected to drive 35 per cent ARPU improvement in four quarters for Jio, it said. &amp;quot;With Reliance Jio plans being 20 per cent cheaper than rivals, we expect the company's robust subscriber addition pace to sustain. Hence, we revise up Jio's FY21 subscriber estimate 17 per cent to 471 million.&amp;quot;  Centrum said Jio has seen the highest increase in tariffs in the 56-84 days' validity plans which have risen by 33-35 per cent, while the lowest increase was seen in the 2GB/day plans for 28 days (12.2 per cent).  &amp;quot;Given that there is some portion of subscribers who may down trade to lower-priced plans and some subscribers may have taken longer prepaid plans in advance, we estimate an 8 per cent increment in ARPU for FY21 and a further 19 per cent in FY22E for Jio,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Resultant, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for Jio sees an upgrade of 16/20 per cent from previous estimates.&amp;quot;  Jio plans, it said, remain the most attractive on the street. &amp;quot;Despite the material uptick in the tariff plans, Jio's plans across price points remain the cheapest on the street, with a discount of 8-20 per cent vs Airtel/ Voda-Idea plans.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;With the superior data speeds and network coverage for Jio, we believe its dominant position in terms of market share growth and data usage will sustain comfortably over the next 18-24 months post this change,&amp;quot; it said.  Morgan Stanley said RIL's chemical Ebitda will decline a 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter in October-December, leading to overall earnings to remain muted despite better refining margin.  However, the trough is unlikely to be sustained as supply rationalisation and normalisation in inventory should help margins, it said.

RI,Reliance Industries signs pact with ADNOC for development of chemical facility,The signing of the agreement in Abu Dhabi was witnessed by UAE Minister and ADNOC Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D Ambani.  ,"Reliance Industries and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) on December 10 signed an agreement to explore setting up of a facility in UAE to produce ethylene dichloride, which goes into making of PVC that is commonly used in pipes, tubes and cable. &amp;quot;Under the terms of the agreement, ADNOC and RIL will evaluate the potential creation of a facility that manufactures ethylene dichloride or EDC adjacent to ADNOC's integrated refining and petrochemical site in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi and strengthen the companies' existing relationship supporting future collaboration in petrochemicals,&amp;quot; the companies said in a statement.  The signing of the agreement in Abu Dhabi was witnessed by UAE Minister and ADNOC Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D Ambani.  The agreement was signed by Abdulaziz Alhajri, Executive Director of ADNOC's Downstream Directorate, and Nikhil R Meswani, RIL Executive Director.  Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used primarily for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which is used mainly in the polymerization manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  PVC is commonly used in pipes, ?ttings, pro?les, tubes, windows, doors, sidings, wire, cable, ?lm, sheet, and ?ooring.  The vinyls industries include construction and infrastructure, agriculture, electrical products and healthcare. EDC is also used as an intermediate in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents and ethyleneamines, and as a solvent in the textile, metal cleaning, and adhesive industries.  The US is the largest producer and consumer of EDC in the world, accounting for approximately 30 per cent of global capacity, production, and consumption in 2018. The US is also the largest EDC exporter, representing about 43 per cent of global exports, as a result of advantaged production economics and healthy demand for caustic soda.  The Indian subcontinent is expected to be the fastest-growing region for EDC demand, with a projected increase of about 17 per cent per year.  &amp;quot;ADNOC would supply ethylene to the potential joint venture and provide access to world-class infrastructure at Ruwais, while RIL will deliver operational expertise and entry to the large and growing Indian vinyls market, in which it is a key participant,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Meswani said: &amp;quot;This is a significant step towards Reliance's commitment to pursue backward integration and will pave the way for enhancing PVC capacity in India to cater to the fast growing domestic market. This co-operation ideally combines advantaged feedstock and energy from the UAE with Reliance's execution capabilities and the growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Alhajri said: &amp;quot;The agreement with Reliance Industries Limited is a product of our strong relationship, spanning over two decades, and a testament to ADNOC's continued ability to cultivate smart and mutually beneficial international partnerships. We look forward to working closely with RIL to identify opportunities to capitalize on the strengths of the Ruwais ecosystem, while delivering a compelling new commercial platform for satisfying the large Indian PVC market, as well as demand for other fast-growing segments in the region.

RI,Sanjay Dutt of Quantum Securities says PSUs will be a big theme over next 2 years,"According to him, one can find opportunities across the sectors &ndash; there are good quality companies in consumption, in pharmaceuticals, in infrastructure construction, banking and financial services.","Sanjay Dutt, director at Quantum Securities, is of the view that there is phenomenal opportunity in the market that investors need to look at that rather than be obsessed by the 5-10 stocks that take the index up or down.  Sharing further details on where this opportunity lies, he said, &ldquo; For the entire B group and the smallcap (excluding the A group), the marketcap at this point of time is Rs 9.2 lakh crore and the marketcap of Reliance Industries &nbsp;(RIL) alone is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it clearly shows that we have a problem somewhere. Markets are totally disconnected from realities.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Therefore, it is impossible to believe that 8,000-9,000 or 5,000 companies, all doing business in the same country total up to a marketcap of Rs 9.2 lakh crore versus one company on one side, which is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it shows that there is phenomenal opportunity in the market,&amp;quot; he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.  According to him, the big theme over the next two years is going to be public sector enterprises. PSUs have been beaten down to nothing but it is matter of time before they will get re-rated. There is immense value there, he said.  When asked about the auto space, he said, &ldquo;The feedback that I get from the channels is that the excess inventory has been pushed out, it has come down substantially but one cannot say that demand is going to come up and things are going to be gung-ho from next month onwards.&amp;quot; It is possible that there are early green-shoots but would still prefer to wait a month or two or maybe a quarter to see auto stabilising, he added.  &amp;quot;The early signs are there, so for people who want to take a risk, be bold and catch it early, maybe they could take a call. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if the numbers are down next month again,&rdquo; said Dutt.  According to him, one can find opportunities across the sectors &ndash; there are good quality companies in consumption, in pharmaceuticals, in infrastructure construction, banking and financial services.  On telecom space, he said, &ldquo;Reliance standalone is an excellent company, excellent investment but till one doesn&rsquo;t get clarity on how to take a telecom exposure on Reliance, I think the only option left is Bharti Airtel right now or for some real brave people there is Vodafone and&nbsp;I am one of those.&amp;quot;  On the financial side, he is not upbeat on Yes Bank, he said.  When asked about the possibility of the goods and services tax (GST) rates going up, Dutt said, &ldquo;The fact is that when the corporate tax rates went down, we rallied for two days and we forgot about it. We never realised that that was the seminal change that happened in Indian macro and corporate history but the market forgot about it and we moved on. Yes, economy has a problem, we do have a problem, GST rate tinkering happens, go up 2 percent here, 3 percent there but is that going to change consumption anywhere? It is not. It is going to change for about a month or two or three months, we will absorb it and move on. I am not going re-balance my portfolio based on GST rates but would look at much deeper fundamentals and other important issues that are going to reflect on my portfolio for the next two-ten years.&rdquo;  &ldquo;My view is going to change when I see some fundamental shifts happening. If the GST rates goes up 2 percent on something, goes down on something, it is not going to impact me in my portfolio as such. It will have a short-term impact,&amp;quot; he said, adding that fundamentally, if we have a problem in the economy, we need to sort that out.  &amp;quot;More than the economy, we have a problem in the financial system today. The single-most problem that we are all living with is trust issue. There is no trust in the financial system. Till that is not restored, no amount of work can be done,&rdquo; he further mentioned.

RI,Reliance Industries: A move to create a highly valuable digital business platform,"As part of this arrangement, the WOS will also take over RIL&rsquo;s ownership of Rs 65,000 crore equity in RJIL.  WOS would hold an interest amounting to Rs 1,73,000 crore in RJIL. Post this, RJIL would become virtually debt-free by the end of FY20 , with the exception of spectrum related liabilities.","In a recent filing by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the company has indicated that it is planning to set up a wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) for all its digital initiatives to create the largest digital platform company in India.  The objective is to make the digital platform holding company along with Reliance Jio (RJio) debt free that will pave the way for attracting strategic investors and financial investors in the digital business at a premium valuation.  What all is included?  The group has created a very strong digital ecosystem through RJio, which has become the second-largest single country service provider with more than 355 million subscribers. The new subsidiary would include Reliance Jio and its platforms viz: MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioNews and JioSaavan and all other emerging digital platforms in the areas of education, health etc.  The objective  After the completion of RJio&rsquo;s major capital expenditure, the group demerged its tower and fibre passive infrastructure assets to make RJio asset light. However, RJio still has a balance sheet of Rs 2,37,000 crore post the demerger.  The primary objective of creating the aforesaid WOS is to make RJio debt free through the rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS) aggregating up to Rs 1,08,000 crore to the WOS. This OCPS issuance by RJio to WOS is towards payment for transfer of identified liabilities of this amount to RIL (100&nbsp;percent owner of WOS).  As part of this arrangement, the WOS will also take over RIL&rsquo;s ownership of Rs 65,000 crore equity in RJIL. Effectively, WOS would hold an interest amounting to Rs 1,73,000 crore in RJIL. Post this, RJIL would become virtually debt-free by the end of FY20 , with the exception of spectrum related liabilities.  Benefits?  The structure need not involve a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;cash outgo at this point in time. However, it can be expected to be in alignment with the redemption profile of the identified liabilities being transferred to RIL.  The most important objective of undertaking this structuring is to bring all the digital businesses under one umbrella.  All digital initiatives of cutting-edge technologies, collaborations&nbsp;and partnerships will happen on this platform.  Through the reorganisation of the capital structure, the equity base of this digital platform gets expanded from Rs 65,000 crore to Rs 1,73,000 crore, entirely held by RIL through its WOS.&nbsp;This will create capacity to onboard strategic / financial investors at a future date.  The digital platform will be debt free.  The coming together of all the digital businesses will make this company the first port of call for any overseas entity looking to harness Indian digital growth opportunities.  Hence, in future getting a financial and/or strategic investor for the digital business at a very good valuation is highly probable.
